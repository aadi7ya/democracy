<h2>Basic Structure and hierarchy</h2>
<p>One of the tenets of democracy is that all members of the society must be equal. For it to function, this equality must be present in the individual vote. Denying groups the right to vote is contrary to the function of a democracy, a system of government where each individual’s vote has equal weight. The U.S. system of government is a republic, a type of democracy in which elected officials carry out the will of the people.</p>
